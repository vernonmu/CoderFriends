CoderFriends
============

##Objective
Use a Firebase backend with Passport and Express to show a user's coder friends.

##Resources
* [passport-github] (https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-github)
* [Github API Docs] (https://developer.github.com/v3/)
* [node-github] (https://github.com/mikedeboer/node-github)

##Step 1: Create Skeleton of Angular App
To mix it up, let's create the file structure for the Angular app first.

* Create a `/public` folder
* Create the following files:
  * app.js
  * services/github-service.js
  * index.html
  * templates/home.html
  * templates/friend.html

Let's create routes for our app:

###/
The base route will display the index.html template. Show a "Login with Github" button that will redirect users to `/auth/github`

###/home
The home route will display the current user's GitHub friends via the home.html template

###/friend/:github_username
This route will display a friend's information as well as what they're currently working on.

Create the server.js file and set it up to serve your static files.

##Step 2: Create the auth endpoints

* Install and require your dependencies
  * express
  * express-session
  * passport
  * passport-github
* [Create a Github app](https://github.com/settings/applications) and then set up the Github Strategy in your server.js with your associated `clientID` and `clientSecret`. Use a callbackURL that will redirect the user to `/auth/github/callback`
* Make sure you use the session, passport.initialize and passport.session middelware
* Set up your auth endpoints:

####/auth/github
Use passport.authenticate with Github

####/auth/github/callback
Use passport.authenticate and upon successful auth, send the user to `/#/home`

##Step 3: Github following Endpoint
Let's link the Angular Github service to our server.js

####GET `/api/github/following`
In server.js, create the above endpoint and have it return the users that currently logged in user follows. You can either use an http request using the `request` module, or you can use the npm module [node-github](https://github.com/mikedeboer/node-github)

Some hints:
* You'll want to make sure that whichever client that requests this endpoint is currently logged in. The best way to do this would be to write a middleware function that runs before the "get followers" logic so that you're sure that the current requesting user is logged in. Your middleware function could look like this:

```
var requireAuth = function(req, res, next) {
  if (!req.isAuthenticated()) {
    return res.status(403).end();
  }
  return next();
}
```

If the client gets a status of 403, it will know that it needs to redirect the user to the `/` page so the user can log in again. **Keep in mind, this will happen every time your server restarts.**

##Step 4: HomeCtrl + Github Service
Now let's connect your Angular app to this setup.

* In GithubService, create a `getFollowing` method that returns the results from the API call we created in Step 3.
* Let's resolve the promise from `getFollowing` into a `friends` variable in the `/home` route. 
* In your HomeCtrl, let's throw friends into the scope and render them in the view.

##Step 5: NG un-authed auto-redirect
We need a way for Angular to detect an un-authed web request (403) so we can redirect them back to the login page. We can do that by injecting a service that acts as an interceptor in Angular's httpProvider. It works sort of like middleware in Node.

```
app.config(function($httpProvider) {
    $httpProvider.defaults.headers.common['X-Requested-With'] = 'XMLHttpRequest';
    $httpProvider.interceptors.push('myHttpInterceptor');
});

// register the interceptor as a service
app.factory('myHttpInterceptor', function($q) {
    return {
        // optional method
        'responseError': function(rejection) {
            if (rejection.status == 403) {
                document.location = '/';
                return;
            }
            return $q.reject(rejection);
        }
    };
});
```

##Step 5: Friend route
Make it so that when the user clicks on one of the selected friends, it loads in that user's latest activity.

####GET /api/github/:username/activity
Create this endpoint in your server.js that grabs data for the given username at this url:

```
https://api.github.com/users/<username>/events
```

* Create a method in your Github service called `getFriendActivity` and make sure it's passed a username
* Have `eventData` be a resolved variable in the app's routing, then render each of the events in the `/friend/:github_username` route in the Angular app.
